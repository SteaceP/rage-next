## 0.4.0 - 2021-08-11

### BREAKING

- **Portable Text:** When encountering unknown block types, the serializer will no longer throw by default - instead if will render a hidden `div` with a message noting that a serializer is missing. A message will also be logged to the console. To use the old behavior of throwing on unknown types, pass `ignoreUnknownTypes: false` as a property to the `createPortableTextComponent()` function.
- **Portable Text:** The `markFallback` serializer has been renamed to `unknownMark` to align with the new `unknownType` serializer for blocks.
